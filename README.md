# NFO-Maker

There are many ways to automatically scrape data for NFO Files, but I wanted a way to add my home videos to Kodi. This NFO Maker makes it possible to add your own videos as movies or tv-shows in a propper way. Just fill out the required fields: Title, ID Type and Unique ID, and all the other fields that you may want. Then click Save and choose where to save your file. I also included one example file "Day on the Beach.nfo" so you can see how it's going to look.

If you have multiple files from one vacation you can also utilize the episode option and have the program make NFO files for the unedited videos.

The program is based on:
Python 3.11.1
Customtkinter 5.0.5

If you want to run the program directly, I also included a .exe file for Windows
